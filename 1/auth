DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fI auth\fR initializes the zx key file to authenticate remote connections,
both for servers and clients.
.LP
This is a temporary aid and the command will change in the future to become
a real tool that can connect to an authentication service to change passwords.
As of now, it must be executed in the machine where the secret resides
to initialize it.

EXAMPLE
.LP
Create a secret for user nemo and group elf for the default auth domain.
This must run on both the file server and the machines dialing to it.
