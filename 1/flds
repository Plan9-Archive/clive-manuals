DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fI Flds\fR prints the requested fields for the given files. Fields are
specified as ranges. A range may be a single line number, counting from
1, or a pair of start and end field numbers separated by a '\fC,\fR' character.
Negative field numbers count backwards from the end of the line (the last
is\fC -1\fR and so on).
.LP
Multiple ranges may be given. A missing start number in a range means\fC
1\fR, and a missing end number in a range means\fC -1\fR. If no range is
given, '\fC,\fR' is implied. And, when such range is indicated, all fields
are printed, one line at a time.
.LP
By default the field separator is a run of blanks. Flag\fC -F\fR changes
the set of runes used as field separators to its argument.
.LP
Flag\fC -1\fR indicates that fields are separated exactly by one instance
of the separator string. Such string defaults to a tabulator character
in this case, unless\fC -F\fR says otherwise.
.LP
Fields are printed in the order indicated by the ranges given (first range
gets printed first). Output fields are separated by default using a tab
character or the\fC sep\fR string if\fC -1\fR is used.

EXAMPLES
.LP
Print the first two fields and the last one from the\fC ps\fR output:
.LP
\fC
.DS L

    ; ps | rf | flds -u -r 1,2 -r -1
    
.DE
\fR
.LP
.LP
In a file with fields separated with '\fC:\fR', and, perhaps with empty
fields, print just the first and third fields in reverse order:
.LP
\fC
.DS L

    ; ps | rf | flds -u -1F: -r 3 -r 1
    
.DE

.LP
Replace the field separator '\fC:\fR' with '\fC,\fR' in all files under
the current directory and update those files on disk:
.LP
\fC
.DS L

    ; gf , | flds -u -1F: -o, | pf -w
