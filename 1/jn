DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fI Jn\fR joins the lines in input files. Each line is considered as a
record, with field numbers counting from 1. The join combines records with
the same key in all files. If a key is found in one file, a line is generated
for it even if it is not found in any other file. Files need not to be
sorted. By default, the first field is used as the key. Flags\fC -k1\fR
and\fC -k2\fR can be used to set a different key for the first file and
for all other files.
.LP
By default the field separator is a run of blanks. Flag\fC -F\fR changes
the set of runes used as field separators to its argument.
.LP
Flag\fC -1\fR indicates that fields are separated exactly by one instance
of the separator string. Such string defaults to a tabulator character
in this case, unless\fC -F\fR says otherwise.
.LP
The output is printed sorted on the key field. Output fields are separated
by default using a tab character or the\fC sep\fR string if\fC -1\fR is
used.

EXAMPLES
.LP
Join the lines of\fC ids\fR and all\fC grade\fR files using the first field
in\fC ids\fR and the second in others. Generate output fields separated
by a\fC :\fR character:
.LP
\fC
.DS L

    ; lf -g ids ,~grade | jn -u -k2 2 -o: f1 f2
