DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fI Lns\fR prints selected lines for files in the input. Lines are specified
as ranges. A range may be a single line number, counting from 1, or a pair
of start and end line numbers separated by a '\fC,\fR' character. Negative
line numbers count backwards from the end of the file (the last is\fC -1\fR
and so on).
.LP
Multiple ranges may be given. But beware, in such case, to avoid storing
the entire file, ranges involving only positive line numbers are printed
first and then ranges involving negative line numbers. Depending on the
ranges given, this might lead to unsorted line prints.
.LP
A missing start number in a range means\fC 1\fR, and a missing end number
in a range means\fC -1\fR. If no range is given, '\fC,\fR' is implied.
And, when such range is indicated, all lines are printed, one line at a
time. This is useful to generate messages into the output for each single
line in the input.
