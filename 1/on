DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fI On\fR watches for file system or user status changes and runs a command
when such event happens. If no command is given the changed file name,
or the new user status, is printed. When a command is given, the command
is executed with any '\fC%\fR' sign replaced with the name for the changed
file or the new user status.
.LP
If the\fI file\fR is a directory it is considered as changed when either
the directory or its contents change. But there is no recursion to sub-directories.
.LP
When\fI file\fR is\fC idle\fR or\fC busy\fR the command is run when the
user becomes idle or ceases being idle. When\fI file\fR is\fC wakeup\fR
the command runs when the terminal resumes from sleep. When\fI file\fR
is\fC user\fR the command runs upon any of these events.
