    usage: srt [-1Ddux] [-F sep] {-r key} {file}
        -1: fields separated by 1 run of the field delimiter string
        -D: debug
        -F sep: input field delimiter character(s) (or string under -1)
        -d: do not print dup lines
        -r key: use this field range as the sort key(s)
        -u: use unix out
        -x: sort each extracted text on its own (eg. out from gr -x)

DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fI Srt\fR sorts files using as keys the ones indicated to the\fC -r\fR
flag, in the order in which they were specified. This can be used to sort
each input file on its own and to sort output from\fC gx\fR or related
commands.
.LP
A key is indicated by giving, in this order:
.IP \(bu
A field range
.IP \(bu
A format
.IP \(bu
An optional reverse indicator
.LP

A range may be a single line number, counting from 1, or a pair of start
and end field numbers separated by a '\fC,\fR' character. Negative field
numbers count backwards from the end of the line (the last is\fC -1\fR
and so on). A missing start number in a range means\fC 1\fR, and a missing
end number in a range means\fC -1\fR. If no range is given, '\fC,\fR' is
implied. And, when such range is indicated, all fields are printed, one
line at a time.
.LP
The format may be one of:
.IP \(bu
\fCn\fR to consider that the field is a number.
.IP \(bu
\fCt\fR to consider that the field is a time.
.IP \(bu
\fCs\fR to consider that the field is a string, this is the default when
no format is given.
.LP

.LP
The reverse indicator is '\fCr\fR', causing a sort in reverse order.
.LP
By default the field separator is a run of blanks. Flag\fC -F\fR changes
the set of runes used as field separators to its argument.
.LP
Flag\fC -1\fR indicates that fields are separated exactly by one instance
of the separator string. Such string defaults to a tabulator character
in this case, unless\fC -F\fR says otherwise.

EXAMPLES
.LP
Sort in ascending string order:
.LP
\fC
.DS L

    srt file
    
.DE
\fR
.LP
.LP
Sort in reverse numeric order (all fields):
.LP
\fC
.DS L

    srt -r nr file
    
.DE
\fR
.LP
.LP
Sort all files in the current directory and write them back sorted:
.LP
\fC
.DS L

    ; lf -g ,1 | srt -x | wf
    
.DE
\fR
.LP
.LP
Sort the second and third fields in ascending numeric order and the last
field in reverse string order, for a file separated with a '\fC:\fR' character,
honoring empty fields:
.LP
\fC
.DS L

    ; srt -1F: -r 2,3n -r -1r file
