DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fI Xp\fR evaluates the expression given as an argument, or those in its
standard input if none is given. When using standard input, each line is
parsed and evaluated as a single expression. The expressions may involve
file attributes. Thus,\fI xp\fR replaces the venerable UNIX\fC test\fR
command.
.LP
The usual arithmetic and logic operators can be used, Values in operations
are considered as unsigned integers, integers, floating point numbers,
strings, or booleans, depending on the context.
.LP
The following functions are known to\fI xp\fR, all operate on floating
point numbers:
.LP
\fC
.DS L

    abs   asin  atanh cosh  floor log2  sqrt  trunc
    acos  asinh cbrt  exp   log   sin   tan   Γ
    acosh atan  cos   exp2  log10 sinh  tanh

.LP
A name that starts with '\fC%\fR' is considered a conversion for\fC Printf\fR
and can be used as a function to print the argument with such conversion.
.LP
Any name that is not a function name and is not a conversion can be used
as a function to ask for the value of a file attribute with such name.
The names\fC r\fR,\fC w\fR, and\fC x\fR can be used as attribute names
and evaluate to a boolean value indicating if the file has any of the read,
write, or execute permissions set.
.LP
Text enclosed in double quotes is understood always as a name. Also, after
calling a file attribute as a function, the next non-blank word is understood
as a name, including characters like\fC /\fR,\fC -\fR, etc., which would
become operators in other places. This is a helper to specify file paths
in a convenient way.
.LP
A string in square brackets represents a time. This can be used with the
relational operators to compare against attributes that indicate times.
The string may use any format understood by the [cmd/opt(2)] package.
.LP
If the last computed yields a value of\fC true\fR the command exits with
success, and if it is\fC false\fR with failure. This, along with flag\fC
-q\fR, is useful to evaluate expressions as shell conditions without printing
their value.
