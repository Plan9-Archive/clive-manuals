DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fI Zxdump\fR creates a tree with a dump for contents of the named file
tree. The dump contains one directory per tree, which contains one per
year, which contains one per day, which contains the tree as of that day.
.LP
The dump is created at\fC /dump\fR unless flag\fC -d\fR tells otherwise.
.LP
The program operates on a local file tree and can therefore be used to
create a dump for UNIX files. But it may dump remote trees as well.
.LP
The dump de-duplicates files, using the SHA of file (or directory) contents
to identify the file.
.LP
Unless flag\fC -1\fR is used, the program makes a dump and then keeps on
running to make a new dump every day at 5am.
.LP
By default, files starting with a '\fC.\fR' or with '\fCtmp.\fR' are not
dumped and contents of directoried named\fC tmp\fR are ignored.
.LP
This command relies on underlying UNIX files to create the dump and (for
now) to read the dumped tree, to let our dump survive any bugs found in
the ZX code as a result of using the development tree.

    ; rc -c 'zxdump -vd /u/dump `{zxrepl | awk ''{print $2}''} '
