DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fI Zxpull\fR pulls changes from a remote tree into a local replica. It
compares local and remote changes and decides which changes must be pushed
and which ones must be pulled. The newest change wins if there is a conflicting
change. File removes are noted and using the modification time for their
directory. If a directory is added or removed, inner files and directories
are added or removed as well no matter if the other replica has changes
for such inner files. See zxrepl(1) for usage examples.
.LP
Flag\fC -a\fR pulls all the changes from the remote without paying attention
to any local file or change made. This flag is meant to initialize the
file tree by making it equal to the remote replica after the replica has
been created, but it can be used at any time and will discard all local
changes in favor of the remote tree.
.LP
Flag\fC -b\fR does not consider local changes when pulling and propagates
all changes made in the remote tree to the local one.
.LP
If no argument is given,\fI zxpull\fR pulls all replicas found at\fC /u/lib/repl\fR.
.LP
When given, he\fI file\fR argument names the replica and the database files.
The replica is the basename for\fI file\fR. The local database file is\fI
file\fR with '\fC.ldb\fR' appended. The remote database file is\fI file\fR
with '\fC.rdb\fR' appended. If\fI file\fR does not contain '\fC/\fR' then
'\fC/u/lib/repl/\fR' is prepended to it.
.LP
Metadata changes at the root of the replica are always ignored.
