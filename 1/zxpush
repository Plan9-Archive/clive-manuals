DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fI Zxpush\fR pushes changes to a remote tree from a local replica. It
compares local and remote changes and decides which changes must be pushed
and which ones must be pulled. The newest change wins if there is a conflicting
change. File removes are noted and using the modification time for their
directory. If a directory is added or removed, inner files and directories
are added or removed as well no matter if the other replica has changes
for such inner files. See zxrepl(1) for usage examples.
.LP
Flag\fC -a\fR pushes all the changes to the remote without paying attention
to any remote file or change made. This flag is meant to initialize the
remote file tree by making it equal to the local replica after the replica
has been created, but it can be used at any time and will discard all remote
changes in favor of the local tree.
.LP
Flag\fC -b\fR does not consider remote changes when pushing and propagates
all changes made in the local tree to the remote one.
.LP
If no argument is given,\fI zxpush\fR pushes all replicas found at\fC /u/lib/repl\fR.
.LP
When given, the\fI file\fR argument names the replica and the database
files. The replica is the basename for\fI file\fR. The local database file
is\fI file\fR with '\fC.ldb\fR' appended. The remote database file is\fI
file\fR with '\fC.rdb\fR' appended. If\fI file\fR does not contain '\fC/\fR'
then '\fC/u/lib/repl/\fR' is prepended to it.
.LP
Metadata changes at the root of the replica are always ignored.
