DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fI Zxsync\fR both pulls and pushes changes for a remote tree and a local
replica. It compares local and remote changes and decides which changes
must be pushed and which ones must be pulled. The newest change wins if
there is a conflicting change. File removes are noted and using the modification
time for their directory. If a directory is added or removed, inner files
and directories are added or removed as well no matter if the other replica
has changes for such inner files. See zxrepl(1) for usage examples.
.LP
If no argument is given,\fI zxsync\fR synchronizes all replicas found at\fC
/u/lib/repl\fR.
.LP
When given, the\fI file\fR argument names the replica and the database
files. The replica is the basename for\fI file\fR. The local database file
is\fI file\fR with '\fC.ldb\fR' appended. The remote database file is\fI
file\fR with '\fC.rdb\fR' appended. If\fI file\fR does not contain '\fC/\fR'
then '\fC/u/lib/repl/\fR' is prepended to it.
.LP
Metadata changes at the root of the replica are always ignored.
