DESCRIPTION
.LP
Network addresses are strings used by clive packages and other tools to
name network services and end-points. They are also used by files and strings
with name space descriptions. This page documents a few conventions.
.LP
An full network address has the form
.LP
\fC
.DS L

    network!address!service
    
.DE
\fR
.LP
where network is the name of a network (\fCunix\fR,\fC tcp\fR, or\fC tls\fR,
etc.) address is the name of a system in such network service is the name
or number for a service
.LP
A partial network address is usually completed as follows:
.IP \(bu
\fChost\fR means\fC tcp!host!zx\fR
.IP \(bu
\fChost!port\fR means\fC tcp!host!port\fR
.LP
.LP
.LP
A full resource address as found in directory entries and name space elements
has the form:
.LP
\fC
.DS L

    protocol!network!address!service!tree!path
    
.DE
\fR
.LP
where protocol is the name of the protocol for the resource (eg.,\fC lfs\fR
or\fC zx\fR)\fC network!address!service!\fR is a network address as described
before. For\fC lfs\fR, this component is never present in the address.
tree is the name of a resource tree (eg.,\fC main\fR,\fC dump\fR, etc.).
For\fC lfs\fR, this component is the absolute path for the root of the
local FS. path is the full path of a resource path within that tree (eg.,\fC
/\fR).
.LP
The\fC lfs\fR protocol indicates access to a local ZX file tree. The\fC
zx\fR protocol indicates access to a remote ZX file tree.
.LP
Commands and packages usually accept shorter versions and complete the
addresses given if they are not full address. Refer to their documentation
and/or source. The usual completion rules are as follows:
.IP \(bu
if no protocol is given,\fC zx!\fR is prepended to the address.
.IP \(bu
other elements may be missing, starting from the last element.
.LP
.LP
For example:
.IP \(bu
\fClocalhost!zx\fR means\fC zx!tcp!localhost!zx!main!/\fR
.IP \(bu
\fCunix!localhost!zx\fR means\fC zx!unix!localhost!zx!main!/\fR
.IP \(bu
\fCunix!localhost!zx!main\fR means\fC zx!unix!localhost!zx!main!/\fR
.IP \(bu
\fClfs!/tmp\fR means\fC lfs!/tmp!/\fR

.LP
Popular network names are\fC tcp\fR,\fC tls\fR,\fC unix\fR, and\fC *\fR
to represent any of the networks when providing addresses to be listened.
.LP
The\fC unix\fR networks lives only within a single UNIX machine and is
not reacheable from outside.
.LP
The map between service names and (eg TCP) protocol numbers is built by
calls to the\fC clive/net\fR package.
