DESCRIPTION
.LP
Files are described by directory entries. Each directory entry is a self-describing
entity made of attribute/value pairs. Most tools in the system operate
by first finding a stream of directory entries provided a set of names
as described in names(3) and then performing some operation(s) on them.
.LP
By convention, there are a few attributes that can be expected to exist.
All their values are strings. Those that imply a numeric value keep the
value represented as a string. Those that imply a time value correspond
to the UNIX nanosecond time.
.LP
Attributes\fC name\fR,\fC type\fR,\fC mode\fR,\fC size\fR, and\fC mtime\fR
and those starting with an lowercase rune are expected to persist. All
other attributes starting with uppercase are not expected to persist in
the file system and are considered as temporary. The tools in the\fC clive/cmd\fR
package decorate directory entries with\fC Upath\fR and\fC Rpath\fR, for
example, to represent the path as given by the user and as relative from
the path as given by the user.
.LP
Attributes\fC path\fR,\fC addr\fR,\fC type\fR, and\fC name\fR will not
be changed by requests that update attributes. The\fC size\fR attribute
for directories is also ignored during updates. Depening on permissions,\fC
mode\fR,\fC size\fR,\fC uid\fR,\fC gid\fR and\fC mtime\fR can be changed;
the same goes for other attributes added by the user.
.LP
Empty attribute names can be used to remove a existing attribute, but it
is an error to try to remove attributes that cannot be changed by the user.
Although\fC mode\fR,\fC mtime\fR,\fC size\fR,\fC Uid\fR, and\fC Gid\fR
can be changed by the user, they cannot be removed.
.LP
This is a list of some conventional attributes:
.LP
\fC name\fR holds the (base) name of the file\fC path\fR holds the absolute
path of the file as seen by the user in the name-space\fC addr\fR holds
the address where to reach the resource.\fC mtime\fR holds the last modification
time for the file\fC type\fR holds a\fC d\fR for directories, a\fC -\fR
for files, and other values for other file types.\fC mode\fR holds\fC 0777\fR
or any other number represented in octal for the file permissions.\fC err\fR
is present only in entries used to report errors on a file during a find
request. Entries with this attribute should be considered as errors, not
as actual entries.\fC uid\fR holds the user id (a string)\fC gid\fR holds
the group id\fC wuid\fR holds the id of the user who last changed the file
