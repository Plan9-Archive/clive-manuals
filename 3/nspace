DESCRIPTION
.LP
This page describes the conventions for the name space. The importzx(1)
command imports the main tree which follows such conventions.
.LP
Clive terminals operate on hosted environments. Clive servers may be native
(not yet, really) or hosted.
.LP
The main tree is usually mounted at\fC /zx\fR and its dump can be found
at\fC /dump\fR. The\fC /once\fR tree keeps stuff not be dumped. The dump
contains a frozen version of the main tree for each day. Directories named\fC
tmp\fR or\fC tmp.*\fR or\fC *.tmp\fR or containing a file named\fC NODUMP\fR
are never copied to the dump. Files with names starting with a dot character
(\fC.\fR) are never dumped.
.LP
The name space is usually specified by either a environment variable (\fC$NS\fR)
or by a file at\fC $HOME/NS\fR. In both cases, the text describes the name
space. The environment variable may be just the path for a file describing
the name space, and acts as an indirection to that file in such a case.
.LP
The description of the name space is a series of lines, one per mount entry.
A line can be a printed directory entry (with attribute/value pairs, as
expected). In that case, the path for the directory is used as the mount
point and the directory is mounted there.
.LP
A line can be also a pair of strings, the first is the path for the mount
point and the second refers to the resource mounted there. The resource
may be a path, in which case it refers to a local file, or it may be a
resource address as described in addr(3), to refer to the addressed resource.

For example,
.LP
\fC
.DS L

    /    /
    /zx    unix!localhost!zx
    
.DE

.LP
The name space is a prefix table and the longest prefix wins, but each
prefix may have more than one entry (i.e., be a union).
