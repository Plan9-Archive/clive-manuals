DESCRIPTION
.LP
Files are described by directory entries as described in dir(3). Read that
before reading the description of permission checks that follows.
.LP
Users and groups are defined by the authentication protocol spoken when
dialing file systems. They are a local to each file tree.
.LP
In general, only bits\fC 0777\fR are honored and their sematics are those
used by UNIX for both files and directories, but for what follows.
.LP
.IP \(bu
Users in the group are granted permission either by the group bits or by
the other bits.
.LP
.IP \(bu
The owner is granted permissions by its bits, or the group bits, or the
other bits.
.LP
.IP \(bu
When new files or directories are created, their group is set to that to
the containing directory unless a different one is specified in the system
call.
.LP
.IP \(bu
The group mode bits for new files and directories are masked with those
of the containing directory, and then any group bit set in the containing
directory is set if it is also set for the user. (NOTE: not yet for the
second edition).
.LP
.IP \(bu
Moving a file requires just write permissions in the parent directories
for the old and new locations.
.LP
.IP \(bu
Creating a file requires write permission in the file (if it existed) or
in the parent dir (if it did not exist).
.LP
.IP \(bu
Only the owner may change the mode of a file.
.LP
.IP \(bu
Changing the size using\fC wstat\fR requires write permissions on the file.
.LP
.IP \(bu
Uids (but for\fC wuid\fR) can be changed by the owner but only if the owner
is\fC elf\fR or the owner is also in the target uid.
.LP
.IP \(bu
Only the owner or anyone with write permission on a file may change\fC
mtime\fR or other attributes not described before.

reference and [zx/perms(2)] to check for permissions.
